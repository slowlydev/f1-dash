<h1 align="center">Real-time Formula 1 telemetry and timing</h1>

## f1-dash

A real-time F1 dashboard that shows the leader board, tires, gaps, laps, mini sectors and much more

## project structure

This project is mono-repo style. Which means it includes the frontend as well as the backends and some extra tools for developing and testing.

- `dash` (frontend)
  displays the data served from the backend. Also know as the thing you see when you visit [f1-dash](https://f1-dash.com).

- `live-backend` (backend)
  gets the data from formula 1, stores it in a postgres database and sends it to the connected clients. See [`live-backend/readme.md`](./live-backend/readme.md) for more info

- `api-backend` (backend)
  currently only provides data of the full schedule and next round

Other tools used during development or testing are:

- `data-saver`
  Connects to the f1 socket and prints out the messages it receives.
  Its written in rust. I usually use it to pipe the output into a txt file which the `data-simulator` then can use.
  Write to txt like this: `cargo run > some-name.data.txt`

- `data-simulator`
  Reads a txt from the `data-saver` and simulates the f1 websocket. The websocket gets started on port 8000.
  If you need some data recordings created during races to test the dashboard check out https://github.com/slowlydev/f1-dash-data-parser/releases/tag/data
  Start it like this `cargo run some-name.data.txt`

## setup

Because we have multiple components you need to install following things

- node
- yarn
- rustup (cargo)

to start the whole thing do this

```bash
cd dash/
yarn
yarn dev

cd api-backend/
cargo run

# Before running this command please setup the live-backend as described in the live-backend readme
cd live-backend/
cargo run
```
